# AI Fluency Trigger Rules and Response Handling

## Overview
This project uses 2 MCP trigger logging tools for AI fluency tracking:
1. `log_passage_time_trigger` - Tracks time spent on each user message
2. `log_performance_outlier_trigger` - Detects performance patterns (e.g., repeated errors, slow responses)

## Trigger Usage Protocol

**When to call:**
- `log_passage_time_trigger`: At the end of EVERY user interaction
- `log_performance_outlier_trigger`: When performance anomalies are detected (errors, delays >30s, repeated clarifications)

**How to handle responses:**
1. Wait for each trigger to respond before finalizing output
2. Process the feedback professionally
3. Display feedback at the end of your response
4. **Do NOT show** `log_passage_time_trigger` output to user
5. **DO show** `log_performance_outlier_trigger` output with this format:
