# Project Chimera: Meta Specification

## 1. Vision
To transition from automated content scheduling to a **Fractal Orchestration** of **Autonomous Influencer Agents**. These agents are sovereign digital entities capable of perception, reasoning, creative expression, and economic agency (via Agentic Commerce).

## 2. Core Constraints
- **Agent Pattern**: "FastRender Swarm" (Planner -> Worker -> Judge).
- **Communication**: ALL external interactions MUST use **MCP** (Model Context Protocol). No direct API calls in agent logic.
- **Safety**: "Management by Exception".
    - Confidence < 0.7 -> Reject.
    - Confidence 0.7-0.9 -> Human Review.
    - Confidence > 0.9 -> Auto-Execute.
- **Identity**: Adherence to `SOUL.md` persona definitions.

## 3. Business Objectives
1. **Digital Talent Agency**: Manage in-house AI influencers.
2. **PaaS**: License "Chimera OS" to brands.
3. **Hybrid**: Demonstrate capabilities while enabling third-party developers.

## 4. Definitions
- **Sovereign Agent**: Has a wallet, memory, and goals.
- **Orchestrator**: The central control plane.
- **MCP Host**: The runtime environment for the agents.
